SwaggerUI changed to SwaggerBootstrapUi (https://doc.xiaominfo.com/en/) 1.9.3

## 4.1.0 Release - 2019-08-07 - Public API supporting the SNOMED browser

This major version includes the API for the SNOMED International public SNOMEDCT browser!
The browser descriptions endpoint is now faster and includes the full set of aggregations and filters to support the browser search.

Another new feature is enhanced character matching for non-english languages. 
Diacritic characters which are considered as additional letters in the alphabet of a language can be added to configuration to have them indexed correctly for search. 
For example the Swedish language uses the characters 'å', 'ä' and 'ö' as additional letters in their alphabet, these letters are not just accented versions of 'a' and 'o'.
Thank you to Daniel Karlsson for educating us about this and providing an initial proof of concept. 

Thank you to everyone who asked questions and provided feedback during another great release.

_Note: The old public browser API project "sct-snapshot-rest-api" has now been archived in favour of the Snowstorm terminology server._

### Breaking
- Description index mapping has been updated with better support for non-english languages. 
Please migrate existing data to the new mapping using the [reindexing guide](docs/index-mapping-changes.md) then run 
the new admin "Rebuild the description index" function found in the swagger API docs.
